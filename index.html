			Online Complaint Management System aims to address the complaints of different users regarding various electronic devices in such a way that it minimizes customer dissatisfaction. The project aims to reduce the prolong processing of the complaints by categorizing the complaints on the basis of different devices and assigning different technicians for addressing the same.

It maintains the record of the complaints lodged by the user and also displays the status of the processing of their complaints. The system aims at simplifying the process and providing efficient user experience.
